For this project, I was tasked with analyzing a study of 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth that were treated through a variety of drug regimens. 
Tumor developent in the mice was observed and measured over the course of 45 days.
Reserachers were interested in the performance of Capomulin against other drugs of interest.

I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for technical report.
